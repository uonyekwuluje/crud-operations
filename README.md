# Crud-Operations
This repository is a collection of solutions for CRUD tasks in basic application development. CRUD stands for:
* **C:** Create
* **R:** Read
* **U:** Update
* **D:** Delete
These functions are necessary to implement a persistent storage application. Persistent storage could be a text file, relational database, non-relational database etc.
I will include the infrastructure, code base and all CI related tasks and operations in this repository
